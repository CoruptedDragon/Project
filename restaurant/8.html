	<h3>The Swiss Cheese Union declared fondue the national dish in 1930, but the tradition of dipping bits of bread in bubbling pots of melted cheese dates back centuries. Indulge in this typical Swiss meal at Restaurant Engiadina, a cozy pine-paneled eatery in the resort town of St. Moritz. There are several kinds of fondue on offer (all served with pickles), but the champagne variety stands out. The friendly staff will be sure you enjoy la religiousâ€”the cheesy cracker-like crust at the bottom of the pot that Swiss natives never pass up.</h3>
