	<h1 style="text-align: canter;">Hotel Hofgarten Restaurant</h1>
	<h3>Hotel Hofgarten is a warm, welcoming establishment housed in one of Lucerne's oldest manor houses.

From the outside, the restaurant looks like a casual pub, but the minute you enter, you sense the elegance housed inside. The space is light and airy. One white-walled dining room has high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and is flooded with light. The other dining area feels like an upscale greenhouse with floor-to-ceiling windows and a gleaming open kitchen.

The chef focuses on fresh ingredients sourced from Lucerne greenmarkets and local cheesemongers. Menu items are seasonal and include favorites such as roasted scallops, porcini ravioli, pumpkin soup, venison, braised veal, poached salmon, and fresh soups and salads.

This is a wonderful restaurant if you are seeking lighter, more sophisticated fare in an airy environment while you're in Lucerne.</h3>
