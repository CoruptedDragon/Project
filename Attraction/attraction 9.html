      <h1 style="text-align: center;">8. The Rhine Falls</h1>
      <h2>Spanning 150 meters, the Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) at Schaffhausen are the largest falls in Central Europe. The best time to visit is during June and July when the mountain snow melts, and the falls swell in volume to spill over a 21-meter-high ledge of Jurassic limestone.<br><br>

      Boat trips up the Rhine provide excellent views of the falls, as do the viewing platforms on both sides of the river.</h2>
