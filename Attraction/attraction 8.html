	<h2>Mirror-like lakes, glaciers, jagged peaks, alpine forests, and oodles of sunshine make St. Moritz one of the world's top mountain destinations and a must-visit on your list of things to do in Switzerland. Palatial hotels and pricey restaurants are par for the course at this chic resort town, which has hosted two winter Olympics.<br><br>

    In the summer, hiking, biking, and water sports abound. Glacier skiing is also available in the summer.</h2>
