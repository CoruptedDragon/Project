    <h1 style="text-align: center;">9. Swiss Grand Canyon</h1>
	<h2>Today, the Swiss Grand Canyon is not only one of the most beautiful areas in Switzerland, but also a preferred destination for hikers, bird-watchers, and nature lovers. It's possible to raft the rapids here between May and October, or rent a canoe or kayak for a gentler route with stunning views of the steep cliffs all around. And we can also campping at night.</h2>
